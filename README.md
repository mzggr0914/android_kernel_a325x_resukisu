# Samsung Galaxy A32 ReSukiSU Kernel

Custom Android kernel for the **Samsung Galaxy A32 4G (SM-A325 series)**, based on the Samsung MT6768 kernel source and integrated with **ReSukiSU** and **SUSFS**.

This kernel is intended for the SM-A325 family, including regional variants such as the SM-A325N and SM-A325F. It has been tested on the SM-A325N. Compatibility with every regional variant, firmware release, and ROM cannot be guaranteed.

## Device Support

- Device: Samsung Galaxy A32 4G
- Target models: SM-A325 series
- Tested model: SM-A325N

- Kernel version: Linux 4.14.357
- Kernel release: `4.14.357-openela-vigus-slmkernel-a32`

Other SM-A325 regional variants may be compatible because they share the same base platform and kernel tree. However, users should keep a backup of their original boot image before flashing.

- SUSFS `v2.2.0`
- KernelSU multi-manager support
- KProbes-based KernelSU integration
- SELinux enforcing
- NoMount `v1.1.1` support
- SUSFS mount hiding
- SUSFS path hiding
- SUSFS kstat spoofing
- SUSFS uname spoofing
- SUSFS `/proc/cmdline` spoofing
- Automatic hiding of KernelSU and SUSFS symbols from `/proc/kallsyms`
- SUSFS open redirect
- SUSFS memory map hiding
- Normalized mount IDs for zygote namespaces
- Corrected mount peer-group filtering
- SUSFS runtime logging disabled for release builds
- AnyKernel3 installation package

## Important Notice

This kernel is intended for users who understand custom kernels, unlocked bootloaders, custom recovery environments, and device recovery procedures.

Flashing a custom kernel may result in:

- Boot failure
- Data loss
- Broken root access
- Incompatibility with certain ROMs or firmware versions
- Knox warranty bit changes
- Other device-specific problems

You are responsible for your own device. Always keep a working boot image or complete firmware package available before flashing.

## Installation

1. Confirm that your device belongs to the Samsung Galaxy A32 4G SM-A325 series.
2. Back up your current boot image.
3. Download the latest AnyKernel3 ZIP from the Releases page.
4. Flash the ZIP using a compatible custom recovery or kernel flashing application.
5. Reboot the device.
6. Install a compatible ReSukiSU Manager build if it is not already installed.

The kernel has been tested on the SM-A325N. Users of other SM-A325 variants should verify that they can restore the original boot image before flashing.

Do not flash this kernel on devices outside the SM-A325 series.

## Building

Clone the repository with its ReSukiSU submodule:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mzggr0914/android_kernel_a325x_resukisu.git
cd android_kernel_a325x_resukisu
```

If the repository was cloned without submodules, initialize them manually:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Set the path to a compatible LLVM/Clang toolchain and run:

```bash
TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/clang ./build_a325n.sh
```

Optional build variables:

```bash
TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/clang \
OUT_DIR=/path/to/output \
JOBS=$(nproc) \
./build_a325n.sh
```

The generated kernel images will be located at:

```text
out/arch/arm64/boot/Image
out/arch/arm64/boot/Image.gz
```

## Configuration

The kernel configuration is assembled from the following fragments:

```text
arch/arm64/configs/mt6768_slm_defconfig
arch/arm64/configs/a32.config
arch/arm64/configs/battery.config
arch/arm64/configs/ksu-a325n-common.config
arch/arm64/configs/a325n-release.config
```

The build script merges these fragments and runs `olddefconfig` before compiling the kernel.

Some configuration files and build scripts retain the `a325n` name because the initial development and testing were performed on the SM-A325N. The resulting kernel is intended for the wider SM-A325 device family.

## Source and Credits

This project would not have been possible without the work of the following projects and developers.

### Base Kernel

- [Samsung-MT6769-Devs/android_kernel_samsung_mt6768](https://github.com/Samsung-MT6769-Devs/android_kernel_samsung_mt6768)

  This repository is based on and derived from the Samsung MT6768 kernel source maintained by Samsung-MT6769-Devs.

### ReSukiSU

- [ReSukiSU/ReSukiSU](https://github.com/ReSukiSU/ReSukiSU)

  ReSukiSU provides the KernelSU implementation and manager-side integration used by this kernel.

### KernelSU Backport References

- [backslashxx/KernelSU](https://github.com/backslashxx/KernelSU)

  Work by backslashxx was used as an important reference for KernelSU integration, non-GKI kernel compatibility, and support for older Android kernel versions.

### SUSFS

- [simonpunk/susfs4ksu](https://gitlab.com/simonpunk/susfs4ksu)

  SUSFS and its original kernel patches are developed and maintained by Simonpunk. This kernel includes a Linux 4.14 port based on SUSFS v2.2.0.

- [JackA1ltman/NonGKI_Kernel_Build_2nd](https://github.com/JackA1ltman/NonGKI_Kernel_Build_2nd)

  A significant portion of the non-GKI SUSFS patch set was adapted from this repository. The patches were integrated into this kernel tree with additional compatibility changes and device-specific bug fixes.

### AnyKernel3

- [osm0sis/AnyKernel3](https://github.com/osm0sis/AnyKernel3)

  The flashable release package is based on AnyKernel3 by osm0sis.

Special thanks to all upstream Linux, Android, Samsung kernel, KernelSU, ReSukiSU, SUSFS, and AnyKernel3 contributors.
